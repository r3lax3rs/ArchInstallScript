-   My own installation script to make life a bit easier
-   Some steps need to be done manually before using these
-   When installing arch fresh even before using the default "archinstall" command to trigger the install script:
-   1. pacman-key --init
-   2. pacman-key --populate archlinux
-   3. pacman -Sy git base-devel --needed --noconfirm
-   4. git clone https://github.com/r3lax3rs/ScriptTesting
-   5. cd ScriptTesting
-   6. chmod +x PreInstall.sh
-   7. ./PreInstall.sh
---
-  Then use the default archinstall script by typing in:
-  archinstall
---
-  When done with that, reboot and login to your account.
-  Open the Konsole (ALT + T)
-  This script is meant for Intel+NVidia users to install video card drivers + configure all settings + make nvidia hook for when there are updates.
-  1. cd ScriptTesting
-  2. chmod +x BasicInstall.sh
-  3. ./BasicInstall.sh
- Reboot the system after this script
---
- If you want to install the programs:
- 1. chmod +x InstallPrograms.sh
- 2. ./InstallPrograms.sh
---
- If you want to install the program without having to enter your password each time:
- 1. chmod +x InstallProgramsNoPW.sh
- 2. ./InstallProgramsNoPW.sh
- Fill password in only once and the script will handle the rest
